# KZG Commitments Over BLS12-381

Proof of concept KZG commitments using BLS12-381 curves using [noble-curves](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-curves) and [galois](https://github.com/GuildOfWeavers/galois)

This library is based off of [libkzg](https://github.com/weijiekoh/libkzg) by [weijiekoh](https://github.com/weijiekoh). 
We specifically used BLS12-381 instead of bn254 due to security and integration with the rest of the VSC tech stack. To learn more about what we are building please go to [our website](https://vsc.eco)
